I built a feature on top of their existing app that allows users to enroll in community challenges and earn points that can be used toward policy discounts. One example is a challenge that encouraged users to upload an image of themselves wearing their homemade mask. This image was then validated by the Clarifai image recognition API which I trained to identify facemask. My submission won 2nd place.",
